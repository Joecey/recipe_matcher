Pseudocode and Notes

Problem:
For the input "food" being an array of available ingredients that the user has in their
home, create a program that matches "food" with a random corresponding recipe from breakfastapi.

The user should be able to chose from two options:
    - strict: recipe ingredients should only contain foods that are part of the "food input"
    - relaxed: any recipe can be used as long as all components of "food" or present
    - lazy: if one ingredient is present in recipe, return recipe

Inputs: available foods
Outputs: Recipe name, ingredients list, procedure, estimated prep and cook time
